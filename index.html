      <b> Why did I choose to study CSE? </b>
      <p>I have interest in computers from childhood. I was really confused between Architecture and CSE. Then I gave it a thought found myself more interested in CSE. <br>
	  Though I wanted to know about computers and how it works but i was a little afraid. So i wanted to win over my fear. Thats why I choose to study CSE.</p> <br>
